This is an example of using the USB dynamic loader to run a USB HID class device
instead of the XTAG2 JTAG firmware. It uses the same mechanism as xrun to load 
firmware onto the device once connected.

The app_l1_hid.h header is the code from the XMOS HID USB Example library with the 
only change to map the USB phy reset pin correctly for the XTAG2. On loading, it moves
the mouse cursor around a 40 pixel square.

To run this, build the binary, connect an XTAG2 then call:
./runDynamic

Do not use xrun or xgdb prior to calling this as once the JTAG firmware has been loaded
this example cannot be loaded over the top. Disconnecting and reconnecting the XTAG2 will
clear the memory.

More details will shortly be available in an application note.
